# RootedInLove
https://rootedinlove.org is a responsive web application for Rooted in Love Incorporated that sells materials written by Drs. James Healy and Madonna Wojtaszek-Healy. It was built using ASP.NET Core, Bootstrap, and MySQL. 

The website is served from an NGINX reverse-proxy server on a Ubuntu virtual machine hosted on the always-free tier of Google Cloud Platform. Its shopping cart service is provided by E-Junkie and payment processing is provided by PayPal. The site is secured with a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. Excluding PayPal's individual transaction fees, site upkeep is $6.00/month.


Note: A depreciated version of this project used ASP.NET MVC (not Core), Microsoft Azure App Service, and Microsoft Azure SQL Server. That project can be found at https://github.com/DanielHealy/RootedInLove-old
